  - Support for Anthropic Claude models (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku)
  - Integration with OpenAI GPT models
  - Access to optimized variants (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini)
- **Browser Automation**: Built-in browser agent capabilities for web interaction using browser-use
- **Multi-Modal Support**: 
  - Text processing and generation
  - Video analysis through Google's Gemini models
  - Audio processing and speech synthesis
  - Image handling capabilities
- **Resource Management**: 
  - Efficient handling of computational resources
  - Dynamic model selection based on task requirements
  - Automatic GPU/CPU optimization
- **HuggingFace Integration**:
