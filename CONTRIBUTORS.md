## Development Setup

1. **Fork and Clone**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AgentOS.git
   cd AgentOS
   ```

2. **Set Up Python Environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install poetry
   poetry install
   ```

3. **Install Development Dependencies**
   ```bash
   poetry install --with lint,test
   ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your API keys:
   # - OPENAI_API_KEY
   # - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
   # - GEMINI_API_KEY
   ```

## Code Style and Standards

We use several tools to maintain code quality:

1. **Black** for code formatting
   ```bash
   poetry run black .
   ```

2. **Ruff** for linting
   ```bash
   poetry run ruff check .
   ```

3. **MyPy** for type checking
   ```bash
   poetry run mypy .
   ```

Our code style follows these guidelines:
- Line length: 70 characters (as configured in pyproject.toml)
- Python version: 3.10 or higher
- Type hints are required for all new code
- Docstrings follow Google style

## Adding New Tools

AgentOS is designed to be extensible through tools. To add a new tool:

1. Create a new function in the appropriate module
2. Follow this template:
   ```python
   def your_tool_name(
       param1: type1,
       param2: type2,
       # ... other parameters
   ) -> return_type:
       """
       Detailed description of what the tool does.

       Args:
           param1: Description of param1
           param2: Description of param2

       Returns:
           Description of return value

       Example:
           >>> result = your_tool_name(param1, param2)
           >>> print(result)
       """
       # Implementation
   ```

3. Add your tool to the `tools` list in `AgentOS` class
4. Add tests for your tool in the `tests` directory
5. Update documentation to include your tool

## Performance Improvements

When working on performance:

1. **Profiling**
   - Use cProfile or line_profiler to identify bottlenecks
   - Document performance benchmarks

2. **Optimization Strategies**
   - Implement caching where appropriate
   - Use async/await for I/O-bound operations
   - Optimize model calls and token usage
   - Implement batching for multiple operations

3. **Memory Management**
   - Monitor memory usage
   - Implement cleanup for large objects
   - Use generators for large datasets
